# Jellybird Art

Welcome to Jellybird, where imagination meets creativity.

## About

I'm Sara Wong, a digital artist exploring the intersection of nature, color, and emotion. My work draws inspiration from the intricate beauty of jellyfish and the freedom of flight—translating these concepts into vibrant, thought-provoking visual experiences.

Each piece is crafted with intention, using digital mediums to push the boundaries of traditional art forms.
